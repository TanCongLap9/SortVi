# SortVi

SortVi is an individual project featuring a webapp designed to visualize sorting algorithm which arranges the array into sequence of progressive numbers.
You can have a look at some example algorithms or you can make your own one. To help with that, we provided an API documentation offering a range of functions to easily manipulate data.
