# SortVi

SortVi is an individual project featuring a webapp designed to visualize sorting algorithms by arranging arrays into sequences of progressively ordered numbers.

The interface provides an intuitive and interactive way to explain how various algorithms work step by step, making it an excellent educational tool for both beginners and experienced DSA learners.

We've provided some popular sorting algorithms for you to learn and explore, such as Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort. You can make your own one also. For that, we've provided an API documentation offering a range of functions to easily manipulate data.

## Features

SortVi offers a range of powerful and user-friendly features that set it apart from other popular array visualizers:

1. Step-by-step execution: Each sorting algorithm is visualized with a slider that lets you navigate through individual steps, such as value swaps or assignments, for a clearer understanding of the algorithm's flow.

2. Visual highlighting: Array elements are represented as bars in a graph, which can then be highlighted with a specific color during execution. Multiple highlights may happen at the same bar, in which case a gradient color is applied to represent the overlap.

3. Animation: Operations like swapping or setting a value is animated with smooth transitions, making the visualization more engaging and easier to follow.

4. Custom algorithm implementation: A part from built-in sorting algorithms, you can make your own ones and test them here too! Our API is designed to be simple yet flexible, and includes many examples to help you understand and use each correctly.

5. Auto-save: Your algorithm code and sorting preferences are automatically saved, so you can pick up right where you left off, even after closing the web app.

6. Responsive design: SortVi is fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience across all screen sizes.
